# SketchMaker Blog (HTML + CSS)



I am learning Full Stack development.
Here I post my progress in my studies and projects that I have implemented.

This is my **third** html and css practice project.

I am posting one of my works. There is nothing but HTML and CSS.
The next project will be with BEM technology and JS


That's all! Smile and work in your spare time!
